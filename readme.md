cd into cloned folder 

npm install

### Production

Build for production

npm run build

npm run start

Note: I'm using pm2 for production server, you should install it on server via 'npm install pm2 -g'.
if you don't want to use pm2, just change pm2 with node in package.json file in scripts section.
